"""Setup script for the iree-onnx-ep Python package.

Currently, we use IREE_ONNX_EP_BUILD_DIR to specify the build directory used by
the developer to built the library. The library is built externally via cmake
and not by this setup script. It is only required at install time, not at
runtime. For editable installs, setup.py only validates the setup.py exists in
the build directory, it doesn't copy or generate any files. At runtime,
``get_library_path()`` finds the library by walking up from the package's
source location to ``<project_root>/build/``. This means rebuilds are picked up
immediately without reinstalling. For wheel builds (``pip wheel`` / ``pip
install``), setup.py copies the library into the package directory so it is
bundled in the wheel.

Note that this is a very temporary setup. We are never going to ship like this.
The only reason we started out like this is because before this we were hardcoding
library paths, which didn't work when trying to develop the library on macos
vs linux (.dylib vs .so). We will eventually probably do something similar to
shortfin, where we have a devme.py file to get things setup for dev workflow,
and let the setup.py build a normal build and a tracy enabled build.
